Welcome to the First International Conference on Grounding Language Understanding (GLU~2017).

In a world where robots and intelligent systems are sharing the same environment with humans, new challenges in human-machine interaction emerge.
Problems of online grounded language acquisition, understanding and visualisation in the context of mixed-initiative human-agent interactions become essential if humans and machines are to understand each other and co-exist smoothly.
The scientific community is aware of the challenge and a number of venues have been created to discuss progress.
Noteworthy, for example, is Google workshop on Language Grounding for Robotics happening three weeks before GLU~2017 in Vancouver, Canada.

Funding agencies are also focusing on this challenge.
An example is the CHIST-ERA call for Human Language Understanding: Grounding Language Learning that funded a number of projects including IGLU (Interactive Grounded Language Understanding).
The GLU~2017 workshop originates from the need to share results between the projects that were funded within this call, but quickly assumed a much wider scope.
Researchers from 17 countries spanning 4 continents are attending the workshop.
More importantly, many different domains are included, ranging from developmental robotics, speech technology, machine learning, cognitive and systems neuroscience.

We received 21 submissions to the workshop. All submissions received at least three reviews from the Scientific Committee (in some cases four reviews were performed). Following the review suggestions and scores, 12 papers were accepted for oral presentation, 6 for poster presentation and 3 were rejected.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Prof. Jean Rouat from Université de Sherbrooke, Canada, for his advice and help in organising this workshop. Without his contribution, the workshop would have assumed a very different form. We would also like to thank the members of the scientific committee for their help with ensuring the high standards of publication in these workshop proceedings.
