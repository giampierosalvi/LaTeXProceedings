Welcome to the First International Conference on Grounding Language Understanding (GLU 2017).

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Prof. Jean Rouat from Université de Sherbrooke, Canada, for his advice and help in organising this workshop. Without his contribution, the workshop would have assumed a very different form. We would also like to thank the members of the scientific committee for their help with ensuring the high standards of publication in these workshop proceedings.

\includepaper{Binding through assemblies in the human brain: Recent data and models}{Robert Legenstein}{keynotes/GLU2017_keynote_01} % fix info
%Recent experimental data has provided valuable insights into the representation of concepts and language in the human brain. Electrode recordings from the human brain suggest that concepts are represented in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) through sparse sets of neurons (assemblies). Further, fMRI recordings from the human brain suggest that specific subregions of the temporal cortex are dedicated to the representation of specific roles (e.g., subject or object) of concepts in a sentence or visually presented episode. We propose that quickly recruited assemblies of neurons in these subregions act as pointers  to previously created assemblies that represent concepts. We refer to these pointers as assembly pointers. In this computational architecture, the thematic role of a word in a sentence or episode (e.g., agent or patient) is bound to a concrete filler (e.g., a word or concept) during language processing, an operation that has been termed variable binding. We provide a proof of principle that the resulting model for binding through assembly pointers can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons, and supports basic operations of brain computations, such as structured recall and the flexible handling of information.
\includepaper{Recursion all the way: in Language, Action and Semantic Association}{Katerina Pastra}{keynotes/GLU2017_keynote_02} % fix info
% The phenomenon of recursion has been considered to be a unique characteristic of human language. However, increasing evidence in Neuroscience points to the fact that a fundamental syntactic mechanism is shared between language and action, both of which have a hieararchical and compositional organisation; Broca's area has been suggested as the neural locus of this mechanism.  In this talk, we will present the first formal specification of action with biological bases, the Minimalist Grammar of Action. The grammar allows the development of  generative computational models for action in the motor and visuomotor space. Through the grammar, we present examples of recursion in the action space and how a generative action perception/execution system may account for the phenomenon. Furthemore, we go a step further, arguing that recursion is not a phenomenon that arises in the language or action space only; it is a phenomenon that lies in any 'syntactic' activity, in any space that comprises 'merging' of elements into more and more complex units. We present recursion in the Semantic Association space (Semantic Memory), through the PRAXICON, the first ever recursive and referential semantic network. We will demonstrate the importance of the network in generalisation and reasoning for a number of applications and discuss the interdisciplinary implications of our argument on recursion.
